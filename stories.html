            My mother struggled to support our family after a terrorist attack
            which took my father's life, so decided to marry me off to a man
            three times my age when i was just 12 years old. I was shocked and
            couldn’t understand what was about to happen to me. I was married a
            few weeks later to the stranger who was the same age as my late
            father.I couldn’t be happy when he beat me or insulted me. I tried
            several times to run away to my mother’s home, but she always took
            me back to his house. I am now a key advocate in the fight against
            GBV and child marriage.

            During the civil war, my neighbours used to help me a lot, bringing
            me food, But as the fighting in our area escalated, people began to
            leave. Eventually, she had no choice but to venture out from her
            home to find food and supplies. The fighters took notice. One
            evening, two armed men knocked on my front door. They asked me if
            there were any men in the house. I was so scared that I said no. The
            men left and I quickly locked the door, but later that night, they
            returned. Around 9 p.m., I heard noises inside the house. Terrified,
            I hid under my bed. Suddenly two armed men entered my room. They
            pointed their guns at my head and hit me with their weapons. One of
            them pressed his gun against my head while the other began taking
            off my clothes. Then, he raped me while the other one watched.
            Afterward, they swapped places.The next day, the men returned again,
            this time with two more men. They stayed with me for four nights,
            doing the same things to me repeatedly.

            “I changed physically after childbirth. Now, I understand that’s
            normal, but at that time, I saw it as a problem. I had gained some
            weight and was constantly hearing remarks from him about it – how I
            had become ‘fat’ and ‘ugly.’ His criticisms went very deep, even
            affecting our intimacy. He kept pointing out that it was my fault.
            As my husband grew more emotionally abusive, questioning who could
            possibly love me, I blamed myself. I was so hard on myself, feeling
            like I wasn’t a good mother or wife. I couldn’t lose the weight I’d
            gained. Then my milk started drying up, and the baby became anxious
            because she wasn’t getting enough to eat. I was living in this
            constant chaos and stress.

            When I found out, the family I was staying with asked me to leave,
            saying I was too big of a responsibility. I didn’t know where to go.
            I moved from place to place. I tried staying in shelters, but they
            wouldn’t allow me because of my situation, even families refused to
            host me. Sadly, the stigma around sexual violence often isolates
            survivors. And in times of conflict and crisis, when the needs of
            women and girls are highest, access to services and support shrinks.
            When I reached a point of utter despair, a stranger told her about a
            facility supported by UNFPA that could provide the care I sought.
            When I joined the centre, they provided me with help, both
            psychological and medical. They also referred me to a hospital to
            check on my condition and provided me with some financial
            assistance.

            The first nine years of my life were wonderful. However, beginning
            in 1967, my childhood was abruptly changed forever. Often, when I
            would go to play at my best friend’s house, his older brother would
            be home hiding in the shadows waiting for his opportunity to abuse
            me. I remember being there and hearing a door locking, knowing I was
            in trouble. I would get this sinking feeling in my gut, dreading
            what was in store for me. My friend would hold me down while his
            brother attacked me. At the time, I did not know if my friend’s
            brother held power over him too, forcing him to cooperate, or
            whether my friend willingly participated. All I knew was that it was
            wrong, and it made me feel sick. Afterwards, I would run home to
            shower, desperate to wash off this filthy feeling of utter guilt and
            shame. Experiencing this abuse from him for nearly three years — and
            wondering why my friend did not come to my defense and stop the
            abuse — made an impact on me and my mental health. Decades later, I
            think back, wondering how I could possibly have considered this boy
            to be my best friend.

          <p>
            I was one of 30 siblings and as a child endured the harmful traditional practice of FGM, whereby female genital organs are altered or injured for non-medical reasons. Growing up,I worked hard to pursue my dream of becoming a doctor and was on course when I was forced to marry. When I was told I was going to my wedding instead of school, I broke down in tears.Trapped in a violent marriage, I was forced to leave Mali to live with my husband who found work in Spain. In my culture, when a woman marries, it’s the man who decides your destiny. It was not until I learnt to speak Spanish that freedom came within reach and I felt able to take the courageous step of reporting my abusive husband to the authorities. I was the first woman among all my fellow countrywomen here to file a complaint. It was very difficult. There was a lot of physical and sexual violence in my marriage. I have been rejected by my family and ostracized for breaking cultural norms and speaking out against gender-based violence, discrimination and FGM.

            After we married, Jozef took control our finances. I had high earnings and bonuses and Jozef invested my earnings in Poland. I never questioned his judgment or asked for details of the investments, I believed he was saving for our future together.As our relationship progressed, Jozef became increasingly controlling about where I went and who I saw and would often question me about my movements.  I told myself he was jealous because he loved me so much. Jozef also became increasingly emotionally and verbally abusive. In was later fired and forced to leave with a substantial compensation package. I became quite low at this time and I relied on Jozef more then. I wasn’t interested in the stock market, particularly in Poland and I wanted to focus my mind on getting better and finding another job. I  later realised the rent was not being paid. The landlady came to the house, Jozef was at work at the time. I was completely horrified to learn we hadn’t paid any rent for four months and an eviction was imminent. I could offer no explanation other than that my husband deals with the bills. I was certain the situation would be resolved, that we actually had lots of money. She looked at me in disbelief and told me we needed to pack up because the eviction would go ahead unless she was paid in full by the end of that week. Upset and confused, I texted Jozef as soon as she’d left. I was desperately seeking reassurance from Jozef that all was well. I had no reply. Jozef didn’t return home either. I have not spoken to him since he left for work that morning, just ten days before Christmas. My world started to implode that day as the enormity of his financial abuse became apparent to me. I soon learnt that Jozef fled to Poland.
